<h3>Best Software Tool Special Prize</h3>
<p>Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. 


<br><br>
To compete for the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Judging/Awards">Best Software Tool prize</a>, please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Judging/Judging_Form">judging form</a>.
<br><br>
To be eligible, your software has to be documented and made available under an OSI approved open source license.
