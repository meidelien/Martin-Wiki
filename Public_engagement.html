        <h1>Public engagement</h1>
       
        <p>
        In an effort to reach out to a broad audience, we have conducted media interviews with local newspapers and online magazines that have different audiences, from aquaculture experts to the general public.

        In this article, our project is described in some detail, stating how AGD is a challenge for the aquaculture industry, and explaining how our detection and treatment ideas could help to improve the situation. This interview was conducted at early stages of the project and some of the ideas in the text have been dropped later.
