      <h1>Collaboration</h1>
      <p>A silver requirement for the iGEM competition 2018 is to cooperate with other teams from around the world. During our journey in our biological adventure, we have met other teams from different parts of Europe, to seek their knowledge and not least, their friendship. We have chosen to make a timeline to show how we collaborated throughout our project time and to document our increasing knowledge and friendships along our way to the Giant Jamboree!

      <h3>September 28 to October 14, 2020 </br>Collaboration with Vilnius-Lithuania</h3>
      <p>
        We have collaborated with Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2020 Team they have given us feedback on our code and we have given them feedback on their webpage.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Feedback on code formatting </strong></h4>
        <p>
        Removed global variables in the analysis script, this is considered a bad practice and can cause problems that are hard to track down. Further comments on the optimizers and narrowing down their use has been implemented. Lastly more comments on the accuracy function and comments on what is a function's input / output. In the model code we changed parameter descriptions and a significant alteration to comments on functions, detailing input and outputs.
