      <h3>September 28 to October 14, 2020 </br>Collaboration with Vilnius-Lithuania</h3>
      <p>
        We have collaborated with Vilnius-Lithuania. They have given us feedback on our code, helped with camera settings in the Blender Software and we have given them user experience feedback on their AR project.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Implemented feedback</strong>

        <p>
        Removed global variables in the analysis script, this is considered a bad practice and can cause problems that are hard to track down. Further comments on the optimizers and narrowing down their use has been implemented. Lastly more comments on the accuracy function and comments on what is a function's input and or output. In the model code we changed parameter descriptions and a significant alteration to comments on functions, detailing input and outputs.

        A special thanks to Emilija from Vilnius-Lithuania that demonstrated tips and tricks on how to better use the camera. This allowed us to create better videos that allowed us to show different aspects of the data generated by our model.
