<h1 class="title" id='magicparlabel-52'>Project Description</h1>
<h2 class="section_" id='magicparlabel-2'>Background </h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-3'>Fish farming is the practice of raising fish for commercial gain, usually food, in semi-closed or closed environments on land or at sea, this is the most common form of aquaculture.[<a href='#LyXCite-wiki_AquaCulture'><span class="bib-label">13</span></a>, <a href='#LyXCite-wiki_FishFarming'><span class="bib-label">14</span></a>]. In Norway aquaculture is an important and growing industry, in 2019 the industry generated 72 billion Nok from sale of slaugthered fish, of which 93.9% where salmon[<a href='#LyXCite-SSBaquaculture'><span class="bib-label">2</span></a>]. In addition to that, the export of fish accounts for 11.4% of total Norwegian exports with a value of 104 Billion including wild catch fisheries[<a href='#LyXCite-SSBExport'><span class="bib-label">3</span></a>]. Globally the fish farming market size is growing rapidly with an 4.77% compound annual growth rate, and is expected to reach 376.485 billion USD by 2025 [<a href='#LyXCite-FishFarmingFutureAlliedMarket'><span class="bib-label">4</span></a>]. While fish consumption is growing rapidly worldwide, the over-fishing is unfortunately increasing too [<a href='#LyXCite-FaoAquaFisheries'><span class="bib-label">6</span></a>]. The practice of fish farming can potentially alleviate this problem by reducing the amount of wild capture fishing needed. An important factor for any production is efficiency. Currently there are large losses in aquaculture; in Norway the loss in terms of number of fish, is between 15-20% of which death accounts for a large majority [<a href='#LyXCite-FishdeathSustainability'><span class="bib-label">5</span></a>]. Among the causes of death are parasitic diseases such as lice and Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD). The treatment of a number of diseases also causes a high number of deaths. A good example of treatment causing harm is with salmon lice, where frequent medication has lead to resistance. Making non-medical treatments necessary, these treatments often cause physical harm and stress which can lead to death [<a href='#LyXCite-TheHealthSituation'><span class="bib-label">8</span></a>]. The use of medication, chemicals and feed has a negative environmental impact as well [<a href='#LyXCite-AquacultureEnvironment'><span class="bib-label">9</span></a>]. Reducing fish death will also lower the environmental impact since less medication, chemicals and feed would be needed to meet market demands. Out of many aquaculture diseases we have decided to focus our efforts on one - Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD). Though choice may be arbitrary it is one of the many diseases affecting Norwegian salmon farms and other farms around the world. AGD is an increasing problem in Norway, affecting at least 63% of aquaculture facilities in 2014 [<a href='#LyXCite-Death2018FiskeVelferd_'><span class="bib-label">1</span></a>]. AGD is characterized by lethargy, excessive mucus secretion through multi-focal lesions on swollen gill tissue, respiratory distress and fish rising to the water surface [<a href='#LyXCite-ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom'><span class="bib-label">11</span></a>]. If left untreated, AGD can cause death and massive damage for fish farmers. For example, some reported up to 80% mortality [<a href='#LyXCite-Death2018FiskeVelferd_'><span class="bib-label">1</span></a>], while in Tasmania peak smolt mortality where 10% per week [<a href='#LyXCite-ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom'><span class="bib-label">11</span></a>]. Treatments for AGD exist, like fresh-water bath that kills the amoeba by osmotic shock [<a href='#LyXCite-ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom'><span class="bib-label">11</span></a>]. In addition to that, AGD can be treated with hydrogen peroxide. However, none of these treatments is perfect and often many rounds of treatment is needed depending on severity [<a href='#LyXCite-TheHealthSituation'><span class="bib-label">8</span></a>]. The diagnosis of this infection is unfortunately rather slow and relies on gill score [<a href='#LyXCite-GillScoreTaylorRichardS2009GoiA'><span class="bib-label">12</span></a>] which only detects severe symptoms and often misdiagnoses AGD for other diseases [<a href='#LyXCite-GillScoreCritiqueClarkA1999Fioa'><span class="bib-label">7</span></a>]. Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to all species, like rainbow trout and turbot [<a href='#LyXCite-ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom'><span class="bib-label">11</span></a>].</div>
<h2 class="section_" id='magicparlabel-4'>Our approach</h2>
<div class="standard" id='magicparlabel-5'>Our project To address the problem of AGD we want to create an early detection system and produce an anti-parasitic compound via synthetic biology. Early detection is generally beneficial for all ailments and often reduces the amount of treatment required and this is the case with AGD [<a href='#LyXCite-TheHealthSituation'><span class="bib-label">8</span></a>]. We wish to achieve early detection of AGD by creating a system which detects behavioral changes. We know that change of behavior is an important symptom in many fish diseases and it does also occur as the first symptom in some diseases [<a href='#LyXCite-FishDiseaseMitchellMarkA2011EJNF'><span class="bib-label">10</span></a>]. Even though it is not the first sign of AGD, which instead is an increase in serum sodium levels [<a href='#LyXCite-FishDiseaseMitchellMarkA2011EJNF'><span class="bib-label">10</span></a>], still it is an indicator that would be hard to measure regularly. The reported behavioral indicators are quite extreme, something that makes it an obvious sign to humans, but if the development of these symptoms are continuous, then an automated detection system might pick it up sooner. This would also be true if disease symptoms develop in discrete steps for only a limited number of fish at once, since these fish might remain unnoticed due to the remaining fish normal behavior. While there are many projects working on tracking individual fish and their swimming patterns, our unique approach aims at looking at collective behaviors. The current mentioned treatments of AGD cause a great deal of stress and potential harm. In our project we want to provide an alternative to these treatments. A first step in this direction is to transfer the gene cluster for production of salinomycin, an antiparasitic compound, into E. coli [<a href='#LyXCite-Zhu2017Feb'><span class="bib-label">15</span></a>]. We hope that this would complement our detection system and provide a less harsh treatment than the current industry standard.</div>
