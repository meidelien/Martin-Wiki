<h1>Project Description</h1>

<h4 id="candida">Background</h4>

<p>
    Fish farming is the practice of raising fish for commercial gain, usually food, in semi-closed or closed environments on land or at sea this is the most common form of aquaculture.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming</a>) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture#Fish). In Norway aquaculture is an important and growing industry with a first hand value of 72 billion Nok  in 2019, of which salmon accounts for 93.9%. (<a href="https://www.ssb.no/en/jord-skog-jakt-og-fiskeri/statistikker/fiskeoppdrett/aar-forelopige">https://www.ssb.no/en/jord-skog-jakt-og-fiskeri/statistikker/fiskeoppdrett/aar-forelopige</a>). In addition the export of fish accounts for 11.4% of total Norwegain exports with a value of 104 Billion including wild catch.  (https://www.ssb.no/en/utenriksokonomi/statistikker/muh/aar). Globally the fish farming market size is growing rapidly with an  4.77% compound annual growth rate, and is expected to reach 376.485 billion USD by 2025 (<a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/fish-farming-market">https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/fish-farming-market</a>). While fish consumption is growing rapidly worldwide the overfishing is unfortunately increasing (<a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture">http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture</a>). The practice of fish farming can potentially alleviate this problem by reducing the amount of wild catch needed.  An important factor for production of anything is efficiency, currently there are large losses in aquaculture. In Norway the loss in terms of number of fish are between 15-20% of which death accounts for a large majority (<a href="https://www.barentswatch.no/en/havbruk/fish-mortality-and-losses-in-production">https://www.barentswatch.no/en/havbruk/fish-mortality-and-losses-in-production</a>) . Among the causes of death are parasitic diseases such as louse and AGD. The treatment of a number of diseases also causes a high number of deaths. A good example of treatment causing harm is with salmon louse, frequent medication has lead resistance. Making non medical treatments necessary, these treatments often cause physical harm and stress which can lead to death (The health situation in norwegain aquaculture 2018) . The use of medication, chemicals and feed does also have a negative environmental impact (<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/389623/">https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/389623/</a>). Reducing fish death will also lower the environmental impact since less medication, chemical and feed would be needed to meet market demands. Of the many diseases seen in aquaculture we have decided to focus on our efforts on one. Though choice may be arbitrary it is one of the many diseases affecting Norwegain salmon farms and other farms around the world. 
    </p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem Definiton</h4>

<p>
    Amoebic gill disease(AGD) is an increasing problem in Norway, affecting at least 63% of aquaculture facilities in 2014 (<a href="https://nofima.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Velferdsindikatorer-for-oppdrettslaks-2018.pdf">https://nofima.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Velferdsindikatorer-for-oppdrettslaks-2018.pdf</a>) 
    </p><p>AGD is characterised by lethargy, excessive mucus secreted through multi focal lesions on swollen gill tissue, respiratory distress and fish rising to the water surface [ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom]. If left untreated AGD can cause death and massive damage for fish farmers some reported 80% mortality [Death2018FiskeVelferd:], in Tasmania peak smolt mortality where 10% per week (Gill disease of marine ®sh caused by infection
    </p><p>with Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis). There exists treatments for AGD like fresh water bath that kills the amoeba by hypo salinity [ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom]. AGD is also treated with hydrogen peroxide though none if these treatments are perfect and often many rounds depending on severity (The health situation in norwegain aquaculture 2018). The diagnosis of this infection is unfortunately rather slow and relies on gill score [GillScoreTaylorRichardS2009GoiA] which only detects severe symptoms and often confuses AGD for other disease [GillScoreCritiqueClarkA1999Fioa]. In addition this approach is not possible with all species like rainbow trout and turbot [ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom].
    </p>


<h4 id="approach">Our project</h4>
<p>
  To help solve the problem of AGD we want to create an early detection system and produce an antiparasitic compound via synthetic biology.
  </p>
  <p>
  Early detection is generally beneficial for all ailments and often reduces the amount of treatment required, this is the case with AGD (The health situation in norwegain aquaculture 2018). Our approach to creating an early detection system is by exploiting behavioural changes, we know that behaviour is an important symptom in many fish diseases and it does also occur as the first symptom in some diseases [FishDiseaseMitchellMarkA2011EJNF]. Even though it's not the first sign of AGD, which is an increase in serum sodium levels [FishDiseaseMitchellMarkA2011EJNF], something that would be hard to measure regularly. The reported behavioural indicators are quite extreme, something that makes it an obvious sign to humans, but if the development of these symptoms are continuous, then an automated detection system might pick it up sooner. This would also be true if disease symptoms develop in discrete steps for only a limited number of fish at once, since these fish might be obscured by the rest. While there are many projects working on tracking individual fish and their swimming patterns, our unique approach is to look at collective behaviours.
  </p>
  <p>
  The current treatments of AGD that are mentioned cause a great deal of stress and potential harm. In our project we want to make an alternative to this treatment. A first step in this direction is to transfer the gene cluster for production of salinomycin, an antiparasitic compound, into <em>E. coli </em>[SlnR is a positive pathway-specific regulator for salinomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces albus]. We hope that this would complement our detection system and provide a less abrasive treatment than the current industry standard.
