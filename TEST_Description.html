<h1>Project Description</h1>

<h4 id="candida">Background</h4>

<p>
    Fish farming is the practice of raising fish for commercial gain, usually food, in semi-closed or closed environments on land or at sea this is the most common form of aquaculture.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming</a>) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture#Fish). In Norway aquaculture is an important and growing industry with a first hand value of 72 billion Nok  in 2019, of which salmon accounts for 93.9%. (<a href="https://www.ssb.no/en/jord-skog-jakt-og-fiskeri/statistikker/fiskeoppdrett/aar-forelopige">https://www.ssb.no/en/jord-skog-jakt-og-fiskeri/statistikker/fiskeoppdrett/aar-forelopige</a>). In addition the export of fish accounts for 11.4% of total Norwegain exports with a value of 104 Billion including wild catch.  (https://www.ssb.no/en/utenriksokonomi/statistikker/muh/aar). Globally the fish farming market size is growing rapidly with an  4.77% compound annual growth rate, and is expected to reach 376.485 billion USD by 2025 (<a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/fish-farming-market">https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/fish-farming-market</a>). While fish consumption is growing rapidly worldwide the overfishing is unfortunately increasing (<a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture">http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture</a>). The practice of fish farming can potentially alleviate this problem by reducing the amount of wild catch needed.  An important factor for production of anything is efficiency, currently there are large losses in aquaculture. In Norway the loss in terms of number of fish are between 15-20% of which death accounts for a large majority (<a href="https://www.barentswatch.no/en/havbruk/fish-mortality-and-losses-in-production">https://www.barentswatch.no/en/havbruk/fish-mortality-and-losses-in-production</a>) . Among the causes of death are parasitic diseases such as louse and AGD. The treatment of a number of diseases also causes a high number of deaths. A good example of treatment causing harm is with salmon louse, frequent medication has lead resistance. Making non medical treatments necessary, these treatments often cause physical harm and stress which can lead to death (The health situation in norwegain aquaculture 2018) . The use of medication, chemicals and feed does also have a negative environmental impact (<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/389623/">https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/389623/</a>). Reducing fish death will also lower the environmental impact since less medication, chemical and feed would be needed to meet market demands. Of the many diseases seen in aquaculture we have decided to focus on our efforts on one. Though choice may be arbitrary it is one of the many diseases affecting Norwegain salmon farms and other farms around the world.

<h4 id="problem">Problem Definiton</h4>

<p>
    Amoebic gill disease(AGD) is an increasing problem in Norway, affecting at least 63% of aquaculture facilities in 2014 (<a href="https://nofima.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Velferdsindikatorer-for-oppdrettslaks-2018.pdf">https://nofima.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Velferdsindikatorer-for-oppdrettslaks-2018.pdf</a>) 
    </p><p>AGD is characterised by lethargy, excessive mucus secreted through multi focal lesions on swollen gill tissue, respiratory distress and fish rising to the water surface [ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom]. If left untreated AGD can cause death and massive damage for fish farmers some reported 80% mortality [Death2018FiskeVelferd:], in Tasmania peak smolt mortality where 10% per week (Gill disease of marine ®sh caused by infection
    </p><p>with Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis). There exists treatments for AGD like fresh water bath that kills the amoeba by hypo salinity [ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom]. AGD is also treated with hydrogen peroxide though none if these treatments are perfect and often many rounds depending on severity (The health situation in norwegain aquaculture 2018). The diagnosis of this infection is unfortunately rather slow and relies on gill score [GillScoreTaylorRichardS2009GoiA] which only detects severe symptoms and often confuses AGD for other disease [GillScoreCritiqueClarkA1999Fioa]. In addition this approach is not possible with all species like rainbow trout and turbot [ReviewAGDMundayBL2001Gdom].
    </p>


<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>
<p>Taking advantage of the accurate CRISPR-Cas9 system, our team seeks to detect a specific DNA sequence of the <em>C. albicans</em> genome by using the dead Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9) protein. By inducing point mutations in the RuvC and HNH domain of the conventional Cas9, the endonuclease activity is inhibited. Designing guide RNAs that are complementary to 20 nucleotides of a gene, that is specific to <em>C. albicans</em> will allow the dCas9 to bind to the DNA strand that is being targeted. Since there is no endonuclease activity, the DNA strand is not getting cleaved [C].</p>
<img class="front" src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/3/33/T--UiOslo_Norway--Concept.png" alt="Concept graphic">
<p>By taking two dCas9 proteins and fusing each with one part of a split β-lactamase enzyme, a two-component system is created. Each component binds selectively to one target DNA sequence, which are both specific to the <em>C. albicans</em> genome.
The near proximity of the two DNA target sequences allows the two parts of the β-lactamase, bound to the dCas9 to join and be enzymatically active again. Adding the substrate nitrocefin to the reaction solution that will be hydrolysed by the β-lactamase will provide a simple red colour readout suitable for the consumer [9, 10].
In order to obtain free <em>C. albicans</em> DNA we want to use an enzyme that selectively disrupts fungal cell walls, but not bacterial or human cells. Since the fungal cell wall mainly consists of polysaccharides, namely β-glucan and mannan sugar polymers. Glucanase is used to break down the glucan and thereby performing selective cell lysis [7]. The sample will only contain free DNA of yeast, but no bacterial free DNA. This will eliminate a lot of false positive results.

<p>Upon a suspected <em>C. albicans infection</em>, the woman goes to a physician or a pharmacist for diagnosis. The physician or pharmacist will use a sterile swab to collect a vaginal sample. This swab will then be inserted into the Canditect detection kit. </p>
<p>Inside the detection kit, glucanase enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the β-glucan bond in the yeast cell wall. Together with mechanical force, this will lyse the yeast cell wall, freeing the DNA. Two dCas9 enzymes, each fused to a split β-lactamase, will recognize their target sequence in the <em>C. albicans DNA</em>. When the dCas9 binds the DNA, the β-lactamase will be functional again, converting its substrate, nitrocefin, to a hydrolyzed product with a red color. This will yield an easy color readout, which can be observed with the naked eye in the detection kit window.</p>

<h4 id="future">Future perspectives</h4>
<p>The beauty of this system is its sheer flexibility. By changing the guide RNA, we can adapt the system to detect almost any organism containing DNA, with high accuracy. If we are successful, our system can be readily applied to cover diagnostics for several diseases.</p>
