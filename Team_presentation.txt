Muhammed is studying in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. This year, he gave his thesis on the effects of salinomycin, one of the basic chemicals of the project, on cancer stem cells. 
He says he is involved in iGEM because he has an interest in biotechnology and wants to improve his practical lab skills. He enjoys spending his free time with computer games and books. 

 

Fun fact: He enjoys watching lawn-mowing videos on the internet.
