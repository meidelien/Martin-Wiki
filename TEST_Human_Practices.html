<h1>Human Practices</h1>
<p>One of the silver requirements for the iGEM competition is to incorporate human practices into the project. This is done by careful and creative evaluation of whether the project is responsible and will bring good to the world. We therefore gathered information from experts in their respective fields, which provided new perspectives and valuable insight.</p>

<h2>Views on synthetic biology questionnaire</h2>
<p>
    Questionnaire and analysis
    </p>
    <p>
    Participant filling out survey at Deichman library Oslo, Norway.
    </p>
    <p>
    Creating a questionnaire was a learning experience from our team, causing there to be no obvious red line from design to results. But we did manage to gather data during the corona pandemic and produce some interesting results from that data. We now know better how to go through the howl process next time.
    </p>
    <p>
    After gathering data with a questionnaire, we decided on a later date to change the research question to: how does knowledge of synthetic biology affect views on research and innovation in the field? Some of the survey questions where unrelated to this new goal and are therefore excluded from analysis. For our purposes these questions can be assumed independent and will therefore not change what the data presents. While the questionnaire itself was not created with the new purpose in mind, the data collected does contain relevant information that gives insight into the perception of synthetic biology the by public.
    </p>
    <p>
    We asked 100 people to fill out our survey in Oslo both at a shopping mall and a library. While it is hard to argue that this is representative of the Norwegian population, the sampling locations were separated geographically, and within two different institutions so it might be a good approximation for the population of Oslo. While age was not a specific question the participants seemed to range from 20 to 65 and consisted of 57 women and 43 men. One might expect the demographic to significantly affect one's knowledge of synthetic biology. For example, sampling at a university. But there is no obvious reason why the relation between knowledge and perception should be affected by a demographic. Considering the above bias should not influence obtained data to a large extent.

    <strong>Interpretation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Question 1 is supposed to assess your level of knowledge on synthetic biology, one of the potential answers “playing with nature” is easily interpreted as a perception of the field. From our point of view if interpreted as a perception the group that answers “playing with nature” might have a big overlap with the other groups.</p>
    
    
    <p>
    There is also a simple interpretation of this as a linear scale of knowledge. In which case the participant might view the answers as simply knowledge level 1,2 and 3. Reflecting mostly on how they see themselves compared to their peers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, we have question 2 and 3. In both cases the participant might feel pushed to answer “more innovation”, “more research” as both of the questions seems to imply that this will reduce suffering and increase well fare of fishes.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Hypothesis and prediction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    First hypothesis; question 2 and 3 appears to be of the same type, and we expect them to be heavily correlated. Second hypothesis; looking back at our potential interpretations, as well as interpretation by the participants we hypothesize that subjects who answer, “I know nothing” and “playing with nature” will have similar outlook on question 2 and 3. When “playing with nature” reflect ones perception of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Analysis</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    As represented on this graph 64 of the participants answered I know nothing, 57 of those supported more research and 59 supported more innovation. Further statistical analysis is deemed not necessary as the results are too homogenous for such a small sample size. It is unlikely that we would detect any significant differences that could provide us with greater insight on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Conclusion and discussion</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Our first hypothesis seems to be correct, nevertheless there are some discrepancies between “more research” and “more innovation” in groups “know nothing” and “think I know”. However, given sample size they are too even for us to determine if there is an actual difference here.
    </p>
    <p>
    Interestingly our second hypothesis was wrong. Those who answered, “playing with nature” and those who answered, “I know nothing” do not seem to correlate more strongly than with the group “Think I know”. To the contrary it seems as though “know nothing” and “Think I know” are more similar. It seems evident that “playing with nature” was not interpreted as a negative perception of synthetic biology since there is a 1:1 correspondence with this answer and believing there should be more research and innovation. Nevertheless, there is a chance with such small sample size that this group perceived questions 2,3 as being weighted heavily on fish well-being.
