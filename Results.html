    <h1>Parts</h1>
    <p>Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will add them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. iGEM
        provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <code>&lt;groupparts&gt;</code> tag (see
        below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.</p>
    <p>Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used
        without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your
        documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to
        acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.</p>

        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>Note that parts must be well documented on each Part's Main Page on the <a
                href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page">Registry</a>. This documentation includes all of the
            characterization data for your parts. <b>The part's data MUST be on the part's Main Page on the Registry for
                your team to be eligible for medals and special prizes pertaining to parts.</b> <br><br>
            This page serves to <i>showcase</i> the parts you have made and should include links to the Registry pages
            for your parts. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the
            Registry than by looking at your team wiki.</p>

        <h3>Adding parts to the registry</h3>
        <p>You can add parts to the Registry at our <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry">Add a
                Part to the Registry</a> link.</p>

        <p>We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it
            available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts.
            Documentation includes the characterization data of your parts.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>We have a created a <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Well_Documented_Parts">collection of well documented
                parts</a> that can help you get started.</p>

        <p> You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/Parts"> 2014 MIT </a></li>
            <li><a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Parts"> 2014 Heidelberg</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Parts">2014 Tokyo Tech</a></li>

    <h3>What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?</h3>
    <p>The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Part Name</li>
        <li>Part type</li>
        <li>Creator</li>
        <li>Sequence</li>
        <li>Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)</li>
        <li>Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)</li>
        <li>Design considerations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We encourage you to put up <em>much more</em> information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images,
        plots, characterization data and other information, you must also put it up on the part page. </p>

    <h3>Part Table </h3>

    <p>Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part
        characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry. </p>
