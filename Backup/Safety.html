<h1> Safety </h1>
<p>Please visit the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Safety">Safety Hub</a> to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.</p>

<p>On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can <strong>go beyond the questions on the safety forms</strong>, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)</p>

<h3>Safe Project Design</h3>

<p>Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis</li>
<li>Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants</li>
<li>Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment</li>
<li>Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device</li>
</ul>
