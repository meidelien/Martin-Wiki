<h1>Human Practices</h1>
<p>
At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams’ efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.
</p>



<p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Human_Practices">Human Practices Hub</a>. There you will find:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> an <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Human_Practices/Introduction">introduction</a> to Human Practices at iGEM </li>
		<li>guidance on <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Human_Practices/How_to_Succeed">how to succeed</a> including advice about how to conduct and document your Human Practices work</li>
		<li>descriptions of <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Human_Practices/Examples">exemplary work</a> to inspire you</li>
		<li>links to helpful <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Human_Practices/Resources">resources</a></li>
		<li>and more! </li>
	</ul>
	




<p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution. </p>
