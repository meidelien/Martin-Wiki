<h1> Modeling</h1>

<p>Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. </p>
